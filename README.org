** Features
- syntax highlighting
- automatic indentation
- jump to link inside an Ink file by clicking or =C-c C-o= (links
  between files not supported)
- command to playtest the game from Emacs: =C-c C-c=
  - start the game at a particular knot with the universal argument
    =C-u C-c C-c=

Add =ink-mode.el= to your load-path then add ~(require 'ink-mode)~ to
your =init.el=. If you're a [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] user, add this instead of

  (use-package ink-mode
    :mode "\\.ink\\'")
