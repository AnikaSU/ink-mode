* =ink-mode.el=

=ink-mode= is intended to be an Emacs major mode for [[http://www.inklestudios.com/ink/][Ink]]. Ink is an open-source scripting language for writing interactive fiction, and is developed by [[http://www.inklestudios.com/ink/][Inkle Studios]].

Right now, =ink-mode= includes basic syntax highlighting and a command to playtest the game from Emacs: =C-c C-c=. 

** Installing

Add =ink-mode.el= to your load-path then add ~(require 'ink-mode)~ to your =init.el=. If you're a [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] user, add this instead of requiring ink-mode:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ink-mode
    :mode "\\.ink\\'")
#+END_SRC
